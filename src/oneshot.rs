/// Kanal one-shot implementation is a lock-free algorithm with only a usize
/// allocation in heap. Algorithm serializes states of the oneshot channel based
/// on pointer address in the heap, and also manages memory free operation with
/// same states, without a need to Arc.
///
/// There is a main difference between Kanal implementation of oneshot and other
/// existing implementations. Kanal synchronizes on both send and recv, while in
/// other implementations send could not be blocking/suspending, in Kanal
/// if sender reaches `send` function before receiver calls its `recv`, send
/// will block/suspend until transaction is done. In async API send will not
/// send data unless code awaits the returning future.
///
/// Channel states are simple,
/// WAITING = null pointer
/// FINISHED = full 1 bits pattern of the pointer
/// ANY OTHER ADDRESS = pointer to winner signal address
///
/// Both side of sender and receiver can know which is the winner by a simple
/// fact. If winner is not a pointer to their signal, they are the one that
/// should comply with other signal. In the other word it's like that other
/// state of channel that is which side is the winner is encoded in the
/// instruction pointer. In certain blocks WAITING means loser and in others
/// means winner.
///
/// Both side in start are racing to win the pointer, if one loses, they can
/// find the correct state of channel based on pointer address. If it is a
/// pointer to a memory location that is not FINISHED, other thread/coroutine is
/// suspended on its signal and loser should finish the signal. If it is a
/// pointer with value of FINISHED, channel is dropped from other side, and
/// operation is failed.
///
/// When loser side wants to finish the waiting signal, it should change the
/// pointer address of waiting signal to finished before finishing the
/// transaction. The reason is to avoid any mid transfer cancelation by owner of
/// signal, after change of waiting signal to finished state, under no
/// circumtances transaction cannot be canceled. Unless the owner changes its
/// own signal to FINISHED first, and cancel the transaction by itself.
/// In simple terms, won signal can change to FINISHED state by loser or winner,
/// if loser changes it, it means transaction is finishing and winner should
/// commit to finishing the transaction, and if loser changes it, it implies
/// that loser is canceling the operation completely.
///
/// Memory management is simple, there is no finishing state that pointer does
/// not change to FINISHED, and first one to reach that state is going to leave
/// the pointer for latest owner of channel either sender or receiver to free
/// the heep allocation.
///
/// Write, read and termination are done through the same [`Signal`] that is
/// backbone of Kanal MPMC channels. for more information check `signal.rs`.
